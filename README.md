Challenge One: QR Card Component

I have built this first project as mobile-first; however, the desktop version uses the same styling, as per the design spec.

I have used simple CSS styling, rather than SCSS, although it could be easily adapted to SCSS through the addition of reusable variables.

I have tried to keep this project simple, quick and efficient as I wanted to practice my HTML and CSS skills.

I began by writing out the HTML structure and by giving the divs relevant class names (e.g. "image-container", "text-container") in order to simplify the process of styling with CSS.

I began the CSS by typing out the universal and body selectors; main selector; and the div class selectors. This 'skeleton' approach has helped me to stay focused and ensure all necessary stylings were applied.

I found it difficult to getting the padding/centering correct. The text looked slightly to the right. I fixed it by addressing the margin (10px auto on the text container to center it). I also amended the padding. It looks more accurate now.

I also found a useful webpage with different box shadows which can be copied and pasted into a project:
