Challenge One: QR Card Component

I have built this first project according to a mobile-first methodology. It is also adapted for desktop viewing.

I have used simple CSS styling, rather than SCSS, although it could be easily adapted to SCSS through the addition of reusable variables.

I have tried to keep this project simple, quick and efficient as I wanted to practice my HTML and CSS skills.

I began by writing out the HTML structure and by giving the divs relevant class names (e.g. "image-container", "text-container") in order to simplify the process of styling with CSS.

I began the CSS by typing out the universal and body selectors; main selector; and the div class selectors. This 'skeleton' approach has helped me to stay focused and ensure all necessary stylings were applied.
